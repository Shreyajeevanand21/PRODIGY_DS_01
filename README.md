# PRODIGY_DS_01

Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
"Sample Dataset :- https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL"

This task involves visualizing the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a bar chart or histogram. Specifically, you'll be working with population data, such as the total population by country, from the World Bank.

The goal is to generate a visual representation that makes it easy to understand the distribution of this data. For instance, you could create a bar chart to show the total population of different countries or a histogram to display the distribution of population sizes across countries.

Key Points:

Data Acquisition: Download the population data from the World Bank or use an equivalent dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for visualization. This may involve filtering specific years or countries, handling missing values, and transforming the data if necessary.
Visualization: Use Python libraries like matplotlib or seaborn to create a bar chart or histogram that effectively communicates the distribution of the population data.

Example Visualization:

Bar Chart: Show the population of the top 10 most populous countries.
Histogram: Display the frequency distribution of countries based on population size, grouped into bins.
Tools:
Python Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Expected Output:

The output will be a static image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG) or an interactive plot (e.g., using Plotly) that can be included in reports or presentations.
This visualization will help in understanding the distribution of population across different countries or in different population size brackets, providing insights into population patterns and trends globally.
